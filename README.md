### DCBF Code
This code is mainly based on our previous project ([DCF, CVPR21](https://github.com/jiwei0921/DCF/edit/main/README.md)).

Stage 1: Run ```python demo_train_pre.py```, which performs the **D**epth **C**alibration Strategy.

Stage 2: Run ```python demo_train.py```, which performs the **F**usion Strategy.
